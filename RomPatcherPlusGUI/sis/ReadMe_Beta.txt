ROMPATCHER+ v2.0 (200) BETA


*** How to install ***
This version has already been signed with the LeftUp certificate.


*** Change-Log v2.0 (200) *** 
+ New: introduced #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif, #define statements. This will allow to retrieve system values at runtime to create more flexible and powerful patches. Check the ReadMe_Macros.txt for all the details.
+ New: added new commands, info: return: error: check the demo1-4.rmp patches included.
+ New: Added support for the Warning/Yellow Icon
+ Improved: When applying a patch the error messages and the yellow icon will be shown ONLY if exists the path c:\resource\ErrRd (ErrRd can be a file or a directory). Disabled by default, because these features are useful to the patch-makers only, but could confuse the end-users. To enable them, just create the file or folder c:\resource\ErrRd
+ Improved: The same Open4All.rmp file can now be used to patch all the devices (including N96)
+ Improved: Changed text in the menu' "Remove Patch" has been replaced with "Disable Patch"
+ Fixed: Restored the "LDD Not Found" error message in case that the LDD file is missing
